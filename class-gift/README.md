## Class Gift

### 06-30-2010

The Olin campus electrical distribution system now has a complete real
time power quality monitoring system by General Electric due in part to
the generosity of the Class of 2007. This summer, our Olin Green Campus
Summer Fellow, Phil Dirske, 2011, installed the final piece of this
valuable system which was the Enervista Viewpoint Monitoring
visualization software package. Phil built user friendly monitoring and
trending graphs that will create historical trending archives of power
quality and usage. It will enhance the energy management program
providing energy resource management at a higher level. Students who
have an interest in electricity will find this system educational. Plans
are for increased energy awareness through community display of this and
other mechanical systemsâ€™ statuses thus providing a better understanding
of how our resources are being used.
