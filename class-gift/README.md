## Class Gift

### 04-30-2013

At their 5-year Reunion last fall, the class voted to endow the Green
Fund allowing those who wanted to continue to give toward it to do so
but moving focus of the class gift to another initiative. The class has
since been proposed with two ideas both exploring scholarship funds.
Before moving forward, the Green Fund's gift agreement must be updated
to reflect the College's most current endowment spending policies and
how the class wishes to proceed with management of the fund. In the
meantime, a Big Belly is in the process of being purchased for Olin's
campus. Build Day sustainability projects, such as building furniture to
be placed by the previously funded solar power panels, were also funded
thanks to donations to this class gift.

James Nee ’15, co-founder of Researching Electric Vehicles at Olin
(REVO), shared that funds awarded by this class gift are being used to
construct a motor controller and the accompanying sensor system in order
to follow the open source movement and improve the current design toward
vehicles like bikes and full-sized cars. Additionally, all the work is
being done by current Olin students, so not only is this going towards
increasing the potential for electric vehicles, it is helping Oliners
gain useful skills in power electronics and circuit development. Green
Initiatives Fund student rep., Ben Chapman ’14 also reported that
remaining funds have been awarded to Prof. Ben Linder toward the solar
panel data-logging system. Thank you for your continued support which
allows us to do these great green things.

From Ben Chapman, ’14 ... Money from the Green Initiatives fund
made it possible to finish Olin's first renewable energy installation on
campus.  Approved funding was used to purchase the battery for Olin's
"solar island," an off-grid set of solar panels mounted on a
sun-tracking pole behind the dorms.  The solar island now has two
outlets that offer up to 600W of power for students (or alumni) to use
whenever.  We are planning a movie night to showcase the system,
bringing out a projector and sound equipment and powering everything
from our battery, charged by the sun.  In the future, the panels may
help power the proposed "living laboratory" building, a combined
greenhouse and lab which is proposed to be built right next to the
panels.  The system should last over twenty years, continuing to be a
visible icon of Olin's commitment to the environment.  Thanks again!

From Prof. Art MacCarley ... I want to sincerely thank those who gave to
this fund. Thanks to approved funding that we received for the
"Automotive Technologies for a Sustainable Future" class, we were able
to purchase components, specifically the 5kW diesel generator, that were
used in attempting to convert to operation on dim ethyl ether.  Although
the class didn't complete this work, the project provided great
experience for the students, which was the ultimate project objective.

Colby Sato, ’14 is still in the planning stages of his project.

The Sustainability and Green Initiatives Fund Committee has approved the
following projects for funding this fiscal year:

* $130 to Colby Sato, ‘14 for a Worm Bin project - Colby is working a
project that will enhance our composting program at Olin. This is an
area in which many students would like to improve our processes.
* $650 to Ben Chapman, ‘14 for the Solar Power project - Ben bought a
battery that will be used to store solar power from the small array we
have behind the Campus Center. The intention is to calculate the amount
of power that can be generated in that area. The plan is to build a
living lab in the area, so it is helpful to know how much solar power
will be available for the structure.
* $1720 to Art MacCarley for the Automotive Tech. Class Hybrid Golf Cart
project – Art is a visiting professor teaching Sustainable Automotive
Design course. Olin College Facilities has donated an old golf cart to
this course and students are building alternative fuel sources into the
vehicle. The funding is going toward parts and materials for this
project.

Recipients will take pictures and send a brief description of the work
they complete. Stay tuned!

Good news! The energy dashboard monitoring software provided in part by
the Class of 2007 gift fund has been useful since installed by Phil
Dirkse, '11, during his 2010 Green Campus Summer Fellowship. We can now
see the campus electricity demand base load (kW) through programmed
trending. This better positions the energy manager when negotiating
electricity procurement contracts that may include the purchasing of
shaped blocks of peak and/or off peak electricity. Financial
sustainability, budget certainty and reduced carbon emissions are all
tied to the Olin energy management program.

Also, the Sustainability Steering Committee (which includes Green
Initiatives Fund student representatives) has been discussing the
completion and commissioning of the small PV array already installed out
behind West Hall. We are considering if this project is a suitable
initiative for future funding through the Class of 2007 gift.

The Olin campus electrical distribution system now has a complete real
time power quality monitoring system by General Electric due in part to
the generosity of the Class of 2007. This summer, our Olin Green Campus
Summer Fellow, Phil Dirske, 2011, installed the final piece of this
valuable system which was the Enervista Viewpoint Monitoring
visualization software package. Phil built user friendly monitoring and
trending graphs that will create historical trending archives of power
quality and usage. It will enhance the energy management program
providing energy resource management at a higher level. Students who
have an interest in electricity will find this system educational. Plans
are for increased energy awareness through community display of this and
other mechanical systems’ statuses thus providing a better understanding
of how our resources are being used.
