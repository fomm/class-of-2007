## Class Gift

The Sustainability and Green Initiatives Fund Committee has approved the
following projects for funding this fiscal year:

$130 to Colby Sato, ‘14 for a Worm Bin project - Colby is working a
project that will enhance our composting program at Olin. This is an
area in which many students would like to improve our processes.
$650 to Ben Chapman, ‘14 for the Solar Power project - Ben bought a
battery that will be used to store solar power from the small array we
have behind the Campus Center. The intention is to calculate the amount
of power that can be generated in that area. The plan is to build a
living lab in the area, so it is helpful to know how much solar power
will be available for the structure.
$1720 to Art MacCarley for the Automotive Tech. Class Hybrid Golf Cart
project – Art is a visiting professor teaching Sustainable Automotive
Design course. Olin College Facilities has donated an old golf cart to
this course and students are building alternative fuel sources into the
vehicle. The funding is going toward parts and materials for this
project.

Recipients will take pictures and send a brief description of the work
they complete. Stay tuned!

Good news! The energy dashboard monitoring software provided in part by
the Class of 2007 gift fund has been useful since installed by Phil
Dirkse, '11, during his 2010 Green Campus Summer Fellowship. We can now
see the campus electricity demand base load (kW) through programmed
trending. This better positions the energy manager when negotiating
electricity procurement contracts that may include the purchasing of
shaped blocks of peak and/or off peak electricity. Financial
sustainability, budget certainty and reduced carbon emissions are all
tied to the Olin energy management program.

Also, the Sustainability Steering Committee (which includes Green
Initiatives Fund student representatives) has been discussing the
completion and commissioning of the small PV array already installed out
behind West Hall. We are considering if this project is a suitable
initiative for future funding through the Class of 2007 gift.

The Olin campus electrical distribution system now has a complete real
time power quality monitoring system by General Electric due in part to
the generosity of the Class of 2007. This summer, our Olin Green Campus
Summer Fellow, Phil Dirske, 2011, installed the final piece of this
valuable system which was the Enervista Viewpoint Monitoring
visualization software package. Phil built user friendly monitoring and
trending graphs that will create historical trending archives of power
quality and usage. It will enhance the energy management program
providing energy resource management at a higher level. Students who
have an interest in electricity will find this system educational. Plans
are for increased energy awareness through community display of this and
other mechanical systems’ statuses thus providing a better understanding
of how our resources are being used.
