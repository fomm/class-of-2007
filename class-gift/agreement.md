## Class of 2007 Gift Agreement: Green Initiatives Fund

*Latest Revisions: 4/26/2013; Approved:**(date)*

Established as their senior class gift, the members of the Class of 2007
present this endowment to fund **green initiatives** at Olin College. To
ensure that the initiatives undertaken yield measurable results, the
class has set the following guidelines for distributing the endowment
funds administered by the Olin College VP of Operations in consultation
with the Provost and VP for Development, Family, and Alumni Relations. Upon
reaching their minimum amount to endow, at their 5-year reunion the
class voted to endow the fund. The agreement has been revised to reflect
the College’s updated endowment policies.


1.  Project Selection Process

    1.  Students will be selected by the CORe Executive Board through
        the CORe committee selection process (or current equivalent), to
        serve on Olin College’s Sustainability Committee, which consists
        of representation from both faculty and staff, including the
        Director of Facilities for the Town of Needham.

        1.  Charge:

            1.  The Committee will send out requests for proposals to
                the community.

            2.  The Committee will evaluate green initiative project
                proposals submitted by members of the community and
                decide which project(s) will receive funding for that
                semester or year.

    2.  One student, chosen by consensus by the Committee, will be
        responsible for ensuring meetings are scheduled, advertising
        project proposal submission deadlines are met, and performing general
        administration in regard to the green initiatives fund as
        needed.

    3.  All project proposals will be due once per semester one week
        after the committee is formed in the fall and at the end of Add
        Period in the spring. Funds will be assigned as soon as possible
        but no later than the first meeting of the Sustainability
        Committee after the submission deadline.

    4.  The committee is not required to approve a project every
        semester. If there are no applicants, or if none of the project
        proposals are feasible or appropriate, the money that would have
        been spent that semester will remain in the endowment.

    5.  After Financial Affairs closes the fiscal year (or about August
        15), the Office of Development, Family and Alumni Relations will
        provide the Class of 2007 with a list summarizing all of the
        projects funded in the previous academic year.

2.  Funding

    1.  The annual payout made available for distribution from the Green
        Initiatives Fund will be determined by the College’s spending
        policy for endowment funds. Currently, the spending policy is to
        make available from the endowment earnings 5% of a 12-quarter
        trailing average of the value of the endowment fund. Investment
        return in excess of this annual payout will not be distributed
        from the Fund. If, at any time, due to investment losses, the
        fund does not have any accumulated earnings, no payout will be
        distributed for that year.

    2.  The recipients of the grant must only use the money for supplies
        or services that will contribute to the progress of their
        project.

    3.  The endowment will be open to donations from individuals or
        groups outside of the Class of 2007.

    4.  If no money is spent over any period of 10 years after the
        endowment has been established, the Green Initiatives Fund will
        be transferred to the Olin Endowment.

3.  Project Selection Guidelines

    1.  The green initiatives project must have a tangible, measurable
        outcome that promotes sustainability and environmental
        awareness.

    2.  The project must benefit Olin College in some way. However, the
        project need not be limited to improving the college campus.
        Initiatives that improve the college’s relationship with the
        greater community are also encouraged.

    3.  Results of the project must be reported to the Olin Community
        and made available in a publicly accessible forum.

4.  If a situation should arise not explicitly covered by the document,
    the Sustainability Committee should interpret the intent of the
    document, consult with the Development, Family and Alumni Relations
    office, and act accordingly.

5.  Just as in the year 2012 (5-year Reunion), in 2017 (10-year
    Reunion), the Class of 2007, coordinated by the alumni
    representatives, will review the progress of the green initiatives program
    and re-evaluate the intent and execution of the endowment.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this gift agreement
to be duly executed as representatives as of the Effectiveness Date:
